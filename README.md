# predictive-model-for-sales-forecasting
## Summary and Interpretation
### Designed and implemented a predictive model for sales forecasting using historical sales data.

#### Objective: 
Created a machine learning model to predict future sales based on past data.
#### Approach:
The model leverages a dataset that includes sales figures, dates, and product categories. It converts date information into numerical features and encodes categorical data to train a Random Forest Regressor.
### Processed and transformed dataset to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

#### Data Preparation:
The original dataset includes a date column, which was converted into numerical features such as month, day, day of the week, and year. Categorical variables (product categories) were encoded into dummy variables to make them suitable for the model.
### Implemented a Random Forest Regressor to predict sales and evaluated the model’s performance.

#### Model Training:
Trained a Random Forest Regressor using the processed features to predict sales.
#### Evaluation:
The model’s performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify prediction accuracy.
## Output Interpretation
### Mean Squared Error (MSE):
The output of the model is a value representing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the predictions on the test dataset. This metric quantifies the average squared difference between the actual sales values and the predicted values by the model.
### Lower MSE:
Indicates better model performance, meaning the predictions are closer to the actual sales values.
### Higher MSE: 
Suggests the model’s predictions are less accurate and might need further refinement or additional feature engineering.
